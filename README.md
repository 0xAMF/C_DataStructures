# C_DataStructures
Implementation of simple data structures in C.

## About

C_DataStructures is a collection of simple data structure implementations in C. It provides ready-to-use data structures that can be easily integrated into C projects. The goal of this project is to offer efficient and reliable data structures for various use cases.

The following data structures are currently included:

- DS_DoublyLinkedList_C: Implementation of a doubly linked list data structure.
- DS_Queue_C: Implementation of a queue data structure.
- DS_SingleLinkedList_C: Implementation of a singly linked list data structure.
- DS_Stack_C: Implementation of a stack data structure.

## Usage

To use the C_DataStructures library in your C project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ````
   git clone https://github.com/0xAMF/C_DataStructures.git
   ````

1. Include the desired data structure's header file in your project. For example, to use the queue data structure, include `DS_Queue_C/DS_Queue.h` in your source file.

1. Build your project with the necessary files from the C_DataStructures repository. Make sure to link the corresponding implementation file (e.g., `DS_Queue_C/DS_Queue.c`) during the compilation process.

1. Refer to the documentation and code within each data structure's directory to understand the available operations and how to interact with the data structure.
